DevOps 
- Building 
- testing 
- releasing 
- automation (deployment - monitoring - infrastructure )

- Pipe line: automated workflow (assembly line) that moves code from development to production 		by  automating build, test, and deployment stages.

DevOps job is to write these pipelines - tools (GitHub actions, GitLapCI, Jenkins)


- CI: continuous integration - auth test run when code pushed
- CD: continuous deployment - auto deploy to production when test pass

- Kubernetes: platform for automating deployment, scaling and managing containerized 			applications.



_____________________ git _______________________

- git: version management system and distributer.

- git config --global user.name ''
- git config --global user.email ''
- git log
- git status

- git remote add origin remoteRepoURl
- git push -u origin main
- git push --set-upstream origin branchName ==> same as git push -u origin main 

branching 
- git branch branchName 
- git checkout branch
- git checkout -f branchName => (-f) discard changes on the detached head
- git checkout -b branchName => create & checkout  
- git pull ==> fetches changes from remote repo

_____________________ CI/CD Pipelines _______________________

tools: Jenkins, GitLapCI, CircleCI, Azure DevOps, GitHub actions

GitHub pipelines actions: workflow

  Keywords:
  name: define workflow or job title

  on: define triggers (push, PR, schedule)

  jobs: define jobs, their os and steps.

  steps: sequential conmmands or actions.

  run: shell command to excute.

  uses: use prebuild actions.

  with: pass params to actions.

  env: set environment variables.

  needs: make one job depend on another


_____________________ Docker _______________________

Images: standalone excutable package that inclueds everything needed to run a software 
Containers: execution environment
Volumes: persistent data storage mechanism, allows data to be shared between a container and host (computer, server)
Network: communication channel that enable containers to communicate 

commands: 
  (FROM): base image to use
  (WORKDIR): sets the working directory
  (COPY): copies the files 
  (RUN): excute commands in the shell
  (EXPOSE): inform  docker that container will listen to specific network ports at runtime
  (ENV): sets environment variables during image build
  (ARG): define build time variables 
  (VOLUME): creates a mount points for externally mounted volumes
  (CMD): provide defualt command to excute when the container starts
  (ENTRYPOINT): specify default excutable to be run when container starts
